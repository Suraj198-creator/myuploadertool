    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 27/12/2024</p>
    
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how I interact with data while using the TikTok API for personal use. The tool I have developed is intended solely for uploading videos to my personal TikTok account. No third-party users, data collection, or data sharing is involved.</p>
    
    <h2>Information I Access</h2>
    <p>When using the TikTok API, I may access limited information provided by TikTok to facilitate video uploads. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Authentication Tokens:</strong> To verify access to my TikTok account.</li>
        <li><strong>Account Identifiers (e.g., User ID):</strong> To identify the TikTok account where the videos will be uploaded.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This information is used exclusively during the video upload process and is not stored, retained, or shared.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Storage and Retention</h2>
    <p>I do not store, save, or retain any data accessed through the TikTok API. All data interactions are temporary and occur only during the active session required for video uploads.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>No data is shared with any third parties, individuals, or organizations. This tool is for personal use only, and all data remains private and confined to the TikTok APIâ€™s secure environment.</p>
    
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>I take reasonable measures to ensure that the tool and its interactions with the TikTok API remain secure. API tokens and any other sensitive data are used only during the active session and are not stored in any format.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>Since this tool is for personal use, updates to this Privacy Policy are unlikely. However, if I make any significant changes, I will update this document to reflect those changes.</p>
    
    <h2>Contact Information</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact me at:</p>
